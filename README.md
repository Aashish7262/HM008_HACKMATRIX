## AgroRent – Agricultural Equipment Rental & Sharing Platform

---

##  Overview
AgroRent is a digital platform for renting and sharing agricultural equipment.  
It enables farmers to book machinery on demand while allowing equipment owners to
list and monetize their resources through a secure, role-based system.

---

##  Problem Statement
Small and marginal farmers often cannot afford expensive agricultural equipment.
At the same time, many equipment owners have machines that remain unused for long
periods. This leads to inefficient resource utilization.

---

##  Solution
AgroRent bridges the gap between farmers and equipment owners by providing:
- Easy equipment discovery
- Online booking and payments
- Transparent rental management
- Secure and scalable backend services

---

##  How It Works
- Farmers register and browse available equipment
- Owners list equipment with pricing and availability
- Farmers book equipment and make payments
- Owners manage bookings and equipment status
- Admin monitors users, equipment, and platform activity
